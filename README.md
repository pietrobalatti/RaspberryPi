# RaspberryPi
Some projects and scripts I developed with my RaspberryPi 3 - Model B

*checkConnectionScript.sh:*  
If you have a Raspberry Pi and you SSH into it when youâ€™re away, you probably have noticed that every once in awhile the system loses its network connection and you are not able to access to your device anymore. With this simple script if no connection is available, the device automatically reboots so that theproblem is fixed.
